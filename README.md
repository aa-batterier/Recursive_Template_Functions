# Recursive Template Functions
This repository contains functions which creates the most common recursive functions in Common Lisp.

The templates created by the functions are inspired from the templates in chapter 8 in the book Common LISP: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by David S. Touretzky.

The insperation for the functions are from the book On Lisp by Paul Graham.
